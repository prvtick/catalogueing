This Python script reads data from an Excel file, groups products by their category, and then dynamically generates an HTML file to display these products in a catalog format. The resulting catalog includes a search bar, category filters, and displays products in a grid layout, with images and basic product information.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the script works:

1. Loading Data:
The script reads an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame.
It strips any leading or trailing whitespace from column names to ensure consistent access to the data.

2. Grouping Products:
The data is grouped by the Category column to organize products based on their respective categories.

3. HTML Template:
An HTML template is created, defining the structure of the catalog, including styling and functionality like search and filtering.

4. Dynamic Content Generation:
Categories are dynamically added to the filter dropdown based on the data in the Excel file.
For each category, products are listed in a grid format, with each product represented by a card that includes an image, name, brand, and a specification.

5. Filtering Functionality:
A JavaScript function is added to enable filtering of products by name and category.

6. Saving the HTML File:
The final HTML content is saved to a file named catalog.html.

7. Make sure to:
Ensure the paths to your files (Excel and output HTML) are correct.
Replace "placeholder.jpg" with an actual placeholder image path if a product image URL is missing.
If you run this script, it will generate a user-friendly product catalog web page with the data from your Excel file.
